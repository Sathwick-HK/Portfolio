# Sathwick H Kashyap Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! This is a showcase of my front-end development skills, featuring projects built with ReactJS, Redux, JavaScript (ES6), HTML/CSS, and Salesforce Lightning Web Components. Transitioning from a quality-focused role at Amazon (GO-AI Associate), I’m passionate about crafting user-centric web applications.
